- Please refer to the explanation under the padlet link if the descriptions in this ReadMe file are insufficient.
- Sometimes, a YT link from playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMWaZteqtEaLTJffbbBzVOv9C0otal1FO) detailing something might be included if Padlet has no existing good explanation. 

### _Introduction:_
###### The main purpose of the documentation is to raise awareness about the many transformations offered in ADF. Some are quite straightforward and some are not. Due to limited space and to encourage simplicity, elobrate explanations are focused onto complex transformations. Very simple transformations are not stated in this documentation. There are also some miscellaneous features to take note as it can be quite confusing or frustrating when trying to understand a simple concept which are slightly different. Also, certain examples like Azure Functions Activity & API call can't be researched further because of PwC permission restrictions. 

### A) _Simple Transformations:_
_1) Filter ( Under filter modifier ):_
###### This selects specific rows from a dataset based on certain conditions. Sometimes, a siple change of data-type is necessary to ensure the "Filter" transformation is working as intended. 

_2) Derived-Column ( Under filter modifier ):_
###### This creates new or edits existing columns by using custom expressions. The picture attempts to capitalise the names, and also displaying "Yes" or "No" statement based on their salary level. 

_3) Conditional-Split ():_

_4) Lookup ():_

### _B) Data Merging & Integration Technique:_
_1) Lookup Tranformation:_ 

_2) Union Transformation_ 

_3) Join Transformaiton_

### C) _Complex / Hard  Transformations:_
_1) Concatenate:_

_2) Pivot & Unpivot:_

_3) Windows :_

### D) _JSON Transformations:_
_1) FLatten:_

_2) Parse:_

_3) Stringify:_

### E) _Miscellaneous Stuff / Stuff To Be Aware Of:_
_1) Pipeline vs Dataflow:_

_2) Flowlet vs Dataflow:_

_3) File Name Options (list them down below) (multiple output files?) How to fully utilise them:_

_4) Definition of Partitioning:_

_5) Definition of Aggregation:_

_6) Linked Services:_

_7) Integration Runtimes:_

_8) What kind of output to place at sink? How does it work? What kind of logic must I follow:_


Summarise all transformations. State and explain simple transformations only. _[Filter/change data-type/Derived column/select/lookup/union]_

For the rest of the transformations, state and elaborate further:
