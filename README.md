#### _Description:_
The main purpose of the documentation is to raise awareness about the many transformations offered in ADF. Some are quite straightforward and some are not. Due to limited space and to encourage simplicity, elobrate explanations are focused onto complex transformations. Very simple transformations are not stated in this documentation. There are also some miscellaneous features to take note as it can be quite confusing or frustrating when trying to understand a simple concept which are slightly different. Also, certain examples like Azure Functions Activity & API call can't be researched further because of PwC permission restrictions.
